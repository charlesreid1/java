## Mistakes/Learnings

Private/public - PAY ATTENTION
* This stuff is important. Be aware, even in whiteboard questions, what you're exposing.
* Practice keeping things private and providing access methods. The LITTLE things make all the difference.
* always include a toString to make your tests easier 

Javadocs:
* Just do it. Every method.

```
/** Always write a simple javadocs description. */
public static void doStuff(int a, int b) {
}
```

Other things we need to work on?
* Indexing, logic, and details details details
