# Combinatorics Problems

## Racing Gems

This problem is an ICPC programming competition problem.

In this problem, we have a race track
of width x = 0 to x = w, height y = 0 to 
y = h. We have a character that begins at 
the x-axis (y=0) and moves toward the 
finish line (y=h) with a steady velocity v.

You control the character's horizontal velocity,
-v/r to v/r, and your goal is to obtain 
as many gems as possible.

Determine the maximum number of gems 
that can be obtained by the character.
