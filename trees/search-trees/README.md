# Binary Tree ADT

This implements a "simple" binary tree class. The basic methods, stripped down, are:
* insert
* remove
* contains
* findMin/findMax (traversal)

These are implemented as public methods with private recursive implementations.
findMin/findMax can be either recursive or non-recursive.
